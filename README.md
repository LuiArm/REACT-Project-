# Project Overview

## Project Links

- [add your github repo link](https://github.com/LuiArm/REACT-Project-)
- [add your deployment link](https://modest-dijkstra-45d543.netlify.app/)

## Project Description
My project will be a an application where you can look up the top ten Latin American Restaurants.

## API

The API used for this project was created in AgilityCMS where all the information was created and where the API was generated.


```
{data: {
	aboutChef: "Guido Tassi trained at fine dining restaurant "
	description: "An emblem of the Palermo neighbourhood"
	location: "Buenos Aires, Argentina "
	name: "Don Julio"
	image: "url"
} }
```


## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Also, define the the React components and the architectural design of your app.

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP EXAMPLE
- Create and use external api 
- Render data on page 
- Link to different pages 
- Allow user to interact with the page

#### PostMVP EXAMPLE

- Add a map API

## Components
##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| App | This include React Router| 
| Header | This will render the header include the nav | 
| Main | This will render data and include router | 
|Components | This will contain independent route |


Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
|Finding Api  | H | 4hrs | 6+ | TBD| 
|Rendering Data |H | 4hrs  |   hrs  | TBD |
| Making Nav |  H |  3hrs   | hrs    | TBD    |
| Making main | H | 3hrs| hrs | TBD |
|Making Restaurant compenent | H |  4hrs  | hrs    |  TBD  |
| Using route | H | 4hrs| hrs | TBD |
| Styling | H   |   4+hrs  |  hrs   |   TBD   |
| Total | H | 26+hrs| hrs | hrs |

## Additional Libraries
Reactstrap



## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description.  Code snippet should not be greater than 10 lines of code.
